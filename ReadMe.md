I created this with bootstrap and javascript, a simple little web app that lets you add small tasks to your list to complete during some of the mirco breaks you may take during the day.  

Sometimes, you just need a little micro break from work or studying to do something else. The Micro Break Chooser is a convenient online platform designed to optimize your short moments of respite during work. Taking small, regular breaks from working is important to enhance productivity and well-being! With the Micro Break Chooser, you can bid farewell to decision fatigue and let the platform select quick tasks for you, allowing you to return to your work refreshed and ready to tackle new challenges.
